# How to contribute

## Submitting bug reports, ideas, and issues

Please open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/Smithsonian/GBIF-Issues-Explorer/issues) and be as specific as you can. If there is a bug, please include details about your computing environment as well as the output from `sessionInfo()`. 

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/Smithsonian/GBIF-Issues-Explorer/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
