BASIS_OF_RECORD_INVALID|The given basis of record is impossible to interpret or seriously different from the recommended vocabulary.
CONTINENT_COUNTRY_MISMATCH|The interpreted continent and country do not match up.
CONTINENT_DERIVED_FROM_COORDINATES|The interpreted continent is based on the coordinates, not the verbatim string information.
CONTINENT_INVALID|Uninterpretable continent values found.
COORDINATE_INVALID|Coordinate value given in some form but GBIF is unable to interpret it.
COORDINATE_OUT_OF_RANGE|Coordinate has invalid lat/lon values out of their decimal max range.
COORDINATE_PRECISION_INVALID|Indicates an invalid or very unlikely coordinatePrecision
COORDINATE_REPROJECTED|The original coordinate was successfully reprojected from a different geodetic datum to WGS84.
COORDINATE_REPROJECTION_FAILED|The given decimal latitude and longitude could not be reprojected to WGS84 based on the provided datum.
COORDINATE_REPROJECTION_SUSPICIOUS|Indicates successful coordinate reprojection according to provided datum, but which results in a datum shift larger than 0.1 decimal degrees.
COORDINATE_ROUNDED|Original coordinate modified by rounding to 5 decimals.
COORDINATE_UNCERTAINTY_METERS_INVALID|Indicates an invalid or very unlikely dwc:uncertaintyInMeters.
COUNTRY_COORDINATE_MISMATCH|The interpreted occurrence coordinates fall outside of the indicated country.
COUNTRY_DERIVED_FROM_COORDINATES|The interpreted country is based on the coordinates, not the verbatim string information.
COUNTRY_INVALID|Uninterpretable country values found.
COUNTRY_MISMATCH|Interpreted country for dwc:country and dwc:countryCode contradict each other.
DEPTH_MIN_MAX_SWAPPED|Set if supplied min>max
DEPTH_NON_NUMERIC|Set if depth is a non numeric value
DEPTH_NOT_METRIC|Set if supplied depth is not given in the metric system, for example using feet instead of meters
DEPTH_UNLIKELY|Set if depth is larger than 11.000m or negative.
ELEVATION_MIN_MAX_SWAPPED|Set if supplied min > max elevation
ELEVATION_NON_NUMERIC|Set if elevation is a non numeric value
ELEVATION_NOT_METRIC|Set if supplied elevation is not given in the metric system, for example using feet instead of meters
ELEVATION_UNLIKELY|Set if elevation is above the troposphere (17km) or below 11km (Mariana Trench).
GEODETIC_DATUM_ASSUMED_WGS84|Indicating that the interpreted coordinates assume they are based on WGS84 datum as the datum was either not indicated or interpretable.
GEODETIC_DATUM_INVALID|The geodetic datum given could not be interpreted.
IDENTIFIED_DATE_INVALID|The date given for dwc:dateIdentified is invalid and cant be interpreted at all.
IDENTIFIED_DATE_UNLIKELY|The date given for dwc:dateIdentified is in the future or before Linnean times (1700).
INDIVIDUAL_COUNT_INVALID|Individual count value not parsable into an integer.
INTERPRETATION_ERROR|An error occurred during interpretation, leaving the record interpretation incomplete.
MODIFIED_DATE_INVALID|A (partial) invalid date is given for dc:modified, such as a non existing date, invalid zero month, etc.
MODIFIED_DATE_UNLIKELY|The date given for dc:modified is in the future or predates unix time (1970).
MULTIMEDIA_DATE_INVALID|An invalid date is given for dc:created of a multimedia object.
MULTIMEDIA_URI_INVALID|An invalid uri is given for a multimedia object.
PRESUMED_NEGATED_LATITUDE|Latitude appears to be negated, e.g.
PRESUMED_NEGATED_LONGITUDE|Longitude appears to be negated, e.g.
PRESUMED_SWAPPED_COORDINATE|Latitude and longitude appear to be swapped.
RECORDED_DATE_INVALID|A (partial) invalid date is given, such as a non existing date, invalid zero month, etc.
RECORDED_DATE_MISMATCH|The recording date specified as the eventDate string and the individual year, month, day are contradicting.
RECORDED_DATE_UNLIKELY|The recording date is highly unlikely, falling either into the future or represents a very old date before 1600 that predates modern taxonomy.
REFERENCES_URI_INVALID|An invalid uri is given for dc:references.
TAXON_MATCH_FUZZY|Matching to the taxonomic backbone can only be done using a fuzzy, non exact match.
TAXON_MATCH_HIGHERRANK|Matching to the taxonomic backbone can only be done on a higher rank and not the scientific name.
TAXON_MATCH_NONE|Matching to the taxonomic backbone cannot be done cause there was no match at all or several matches with too little information to keep them apart (homonyms).
TYPE_STATUS_INVALID|The given type status is impossible to interpret or seriously different from the recommended vocabulary.
ZERO_COORDINATE|Coordinate is the exact 0/0 coordinate, often indicating a bad null coordinate.
